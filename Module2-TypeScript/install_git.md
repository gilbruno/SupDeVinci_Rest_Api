# Install Git:

## Windows

1. Download the Git Installer for Windows: Go to the official Git website at https://git-scm.com/ and click on the "Download for Windows" link.

2. Run the Installer: Once the download is complete, run the installer.

3. Installation Settings:

   - During installation, you can choose the default settings for most options. However, pay attention to the following settings:
      - Adjusting your PATH environment: Choose "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" or "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" (if you want Unix tools).
      - Choosing the default editor: If you're familiar with Vim, you can keep it. If not, you might prefer to choose another editor (like VSCode).
Continue and finish the installation.

Verify Installation: Open a command prompt or terminal and type:

```
git --version
```
This should display the version of Git you installed, confirming that the installation was successful.
